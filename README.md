# Preact OBS Plugin

This is a template that can be used to build OBS plugins (or webapps!)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HorusGoul/preact-obs-plugin hello-world-obs-plugin
```

The dependencies are downloaded from CDNs, just launch a web server with `npx serve` and use the local URL in your `Browser` source on OBS.

I recommend you to use `npx live-server` to develop, it will reload your website whenever you change one of the files.
