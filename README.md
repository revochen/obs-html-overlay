# OBS HTML Overlays

A simple OBS overlay to generate animated text using the browser source, animate.js and bootstrap.

How to use:

1) Create a new browser source in OBS and set its local file to the main.html document.
2) Create another browser source and set its local file to the setup.html document. Turn this element invisible. Right click on it in the source and pick 'Interaction' to set up the label text, animation and text color.

After any changes made in the setup panel, the main overlay needs to toggle its visibility to reflect any updates.
